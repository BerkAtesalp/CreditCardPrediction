Machine Learning-Assisted Financial Assistant/Coach

This project is developed during the process of "Dijital Okuryazarlık Programı" which is organized by cooperation of Akbank and Patika.Dev

Introduction

In today's economy, effective financial management skills are crucial for achieving economic stability and personal financial goals. As the usage of credit cards becomes more prevalent, monitoring spending habits and managing budgets becomes increasingly complex. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based budget assistance and spending prediction system to help individuals manage their financial habits more efficiently.

Problem Statement

The project leverages credit card spending data and account movements to predict future expenditures and transactions, assisting users in budget management.

Objectives

Predict Future Expenditures and Account Balances: Utilize historical data to forecast users' future spending and balances.

Budget Management Recommendations: Provide recommendations based on spending habits to aid users in managing their budgets effectively.

Visual Reports for Users: Offer visual reports on account movements and credit card transactions categorized by type, and provide time-dependent visual reports on spending and balance data to enhance user understanding and management capabilities.

Features

Spending Prediction: Employ machine learning models to predict future spending based on past transaction data.

Budget Recommendations: Generate actionable insights and recommendations for budget optimization.

Interactive Visualizations: Implement dashboards for interactive and dynamic visual analysis of spending patterns.
Data

The project uses anonymized user data encompassing credit card transactions and account movements. Data preprocessing and cleaning are critical steps to ensure the quality and reliability of the models developed.

Technologies Used

Python: For data processing and machine learning.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For generating static and interactive visualizations.

Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning models.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and demonstrations.
